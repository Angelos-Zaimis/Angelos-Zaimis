# 👋 Hi, I’m Angelos Zaimis  

Software Engineer based in Zurich, currently focused on **high-performance backend systems in Go** and **AI-powered services built with Python (FastAPI)**.

I enjoy working close to the system: concurrency, efficiency, clean APIs, and predictable performance. Alongside this, I design and build production-ready AI services, integrating Large Language Models through **RAG pipelines**, robust APIs, and reliable backend architectures.

I also bring **3+ years of enterprise experience with Java and Spring Boot**, having worked on scalable microservice systems in real-world production environments. This background strongly shapes how I approach engineering today: reliability first, clear boundaries, and long-term maintainability.
