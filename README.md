# 👋 Hi, I’m Angelos Zaimis  

Software Engineer based in Zurich, currently working at **Nu.education** on backend-heavy, full-stack systems.

I have strong production experience with **Java and Spring Boot**, having worked on scalable microservice architectures in real-world enterprise environments. This background shapes how I approach software engineering today: reliability, clean architecture, and long-term maintainability first.

Alongside this, I’m **actively deepening my expertise in Go**, focusing on systems programming, concurrency, and performance through hands-on projects and practical experimentation.

In parallel, I build **AI-powered backend services** using **Python (FastAPI)**, working with Large Language Models through **RAG pipelines**, robust APIs, and production-oriented architectures.
